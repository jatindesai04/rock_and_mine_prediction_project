Rock and Mine Prediction Project

Overview
	This project uses machine learning techniques to classify objects as either rocks or mines based on sonar 	data. The dataset contains features obtained from the reflection of sonar signals bouncing off objects, and 	the goal is to build a model that can accurately predict whether an object is a rock or a mine.

Dataset
	-The dataset contains 60 features, each representing a sonar signal attribute.
	-The target variable is binary, with values representing:
	R (Rock)
	M (Mine)

Project Workflow

Data Preprocessing:
	Handling missing values (if any).
	Feature scaling (Standardization/Normalization).
	Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Model Selection:
	Various models are tested, including:
	Logistic Regression
	
Training the Model:
	The models are trained on the training data, and cross-validation is used to evaluate their performance.

Evaluation:
	Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess model performance.
	Confusion matrix and ROC curve may also be plotted.

Prediction:
	The final trained model is used to predict whether a given sonar signal is reflecting off a rock or a mine.
